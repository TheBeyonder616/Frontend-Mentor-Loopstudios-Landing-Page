## My Process

I developed the Loopstudios Landing Page component featuring a modern design with interactive elements. Key aspects include responsive styling, smooth animations, and lazy loading of images. The project utilizes the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for CSS, which helps in organizing and maintaining styles efficiently.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup:** Used semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS:** Employed custom properties (variables) for consistent styling and utilized Flexbox and Grid for responsive layout. Implemented BEM for scalable and maintainable CSS.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented lazy loading of images and interactive features with vanilla JavaScript.

### BEM Methodology

In this project, I used the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology to structure the CSS, which improves the readability and maintainability of the code. Hereâ€™s how BEM was applied:

- **Block:** Represents the higher-level component (e.g., `.header`, `.footer`, `.main-content`).
- **Element:** Represents a part of the block that performs a specific function (e.g., `.header__logo`, `.footer__info`, `.main-content__section`).
- **Modifier:** Represents a different state or variation of a block or element (e.g., `.header--dark`, `.button--large`, `.footer__info--highlighted`).

### Example BEM Structure

- **Header Block:**

  ```scss
  .header {
    // Block styles

    &__logo {
      // Element styles
    }

    &__nav {
      // Element styles
    }

    &--dark {
      // Modifier styles
    }
  }
  ```

- **Footer Block:**

  ```scss
  .footer {
    // Block styles

    &__info {
      // Element styles
    }

    &__social-handle {
      // Element styles
    }

    &--compact {
      // Modifier styles
    }
  }
  ```

### What I Learned

This project helped me improve my skills in:

- **HTML Semantics:** Properly structuring HTML to enhance accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Leveraging CSS variables for dynamic and consistent styling.
- **SCSS:** Using SCSS features to create modular and maintainable CSS.
- **BEM Methodology:** Applying BEM to structure CSS efficiently and avoid conflicts.
- **JavaScript for Lazy Loading:** Implementing basic lazy loading and handling user interactions.
- **Responsive Design:** Applying Flexbox and CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.

### Continued Development

Future updates will focus on:

- **Advanced JavaScript:** Implementing more sophisticated JavaScript techniques for smoother interactions and performance.
- **Enhanced CSS Animations:** Adding more complex animations and transitions to enrich the user experience.
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Ensuring all interactive elements are fully accessible and improving keyboard navigation.
